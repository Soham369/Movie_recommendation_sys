# Movie_recommendation_sys
The main objective of movie recommendation system is to offer personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences, past viewing history, and behavior. 
This enhances the user experience by reducing the effort required to find interesting content and increasing user engagement.
This project was made during my internship period at Ybi Foundation.
